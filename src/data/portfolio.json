I also had a hand in the database work. We pull game data off Steam using their official web API and formatted it to fit the purposes of our website.</p><p>Built by a group of 7 people, my team consisted of: Chris Gagnier, Jack Wilson, James Allen, Jacob Riesterer, Sam Cooper, and Peyton Miller.</p>",
